# ArduinoRCCar
A RC car built with an Arduino Mega controled by an recicled Controller. 

First of all, on HEADER you have all the parameters that are susceptible for a change pointing, on each one, for what are they like RC transmitter signals that you will have to get of your own transmitter. 

The autostop because of the battery is disabled for doing easier the tests without battery but is ready to work propperly. 

You will need to include the libraries that are updated (BatterySensor and RCSensor) because, if not, it wonÂ´t work.
